# 🌒 *Echoes from the Terminal: My First Log Entry*

There’s a peculiar kind of beauty in broken code.

In the quiet clatter of keystrokes at midnight,

In the glow of a terminal window in a dark room,

In the endless puzzle of systems made by humans,

Waiting to be understood — or undone.

🛠 **Why This Blog Exists**

This isn't just a place to document victories in Capture The Flag events — though there will be many flags.

This is a **living journal**. Of digital warfare. Of elegant exploits. Of nights spent stuck on a bug that vanishes when you least expect it.

Here, I’ll explore:

- 🔐 **Cybersecurity research** – the cat-and-mouse game of 1s and 0s
- 🧠 **Skills** – from reversing binaries to front-end tricks, all part of the hacker's toolkit
- 🧭 **Achievements** – not to boast, but to reflect and grow

🌱 **Where I Started**

I’m not a prodigy. I’m a persistent wanderer.

I’ve Googled the dumbest things.

I’ve cried over segmentation faults.

I’ve screamed in joy after exploiting my first XSS.

Every CTF challenge solved, every vulnerability understood,

adds one more brick to the strange, asymmetric castle I’m building.

🕳️ **Falling Into the Rabbit Hole**

The more I learn, the more I realize how much there is to explore:

- What *is* secure?
- Who gets to decide what’s ethical?
- How far can curiosity take you before it’s called intrusion?

These are not just technical questions — they’re philosophical ones.

And I want to chase them all.

🏁 **Looking Ahead**

This is the start of something raw, imperfect, and real.

Whether you're a fellow cyber traveler, a curious coder, or just someone who stumbled in —

Welcome.

Let’s break things. Let’s fix things. Let’s learn.

*I’ll meet you at the prompt.*
